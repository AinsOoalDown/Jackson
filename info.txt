Discord.js v12 bot template

Template fully made by FuseKInDaHEAD#5450

All features have been tested and working.

The template contains:
- Example commands ban and ping
- event handler and command handler
- sample event message

What do you need to do to fire up the bot?
- download node.js from this link: https://nodejs.org/en/
- download npm (here tutorial: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)
- create a bot (new applications) on discord's website https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Invite the bot to your server disord (invitation generate on discord developer portal)
- create a new terminal (bar at the top) and type "npm i" or "npm and discord.js" and "npm and chalk" (should create a folder "node_modules")
- In config bot (./config/config.js) in the appropriate place enter the token of your bot and (optionally) another prefix
- enter in the terminal at the bottom "node index.js".

Now after taking all the steps, if you did everything correctly you should see on the server that your bot
has an online status, and in the logos color-coded statuses of loading commands and events. Fun
